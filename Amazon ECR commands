Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here . You can skip this step if your image is already built:
docker build -t coursera_project .

After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
docker tag coursera_project:latest ******.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/coursera_project:latest

Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
docker push ****.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/coursera_project:latest
